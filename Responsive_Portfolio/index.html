                            Bryan is first and foremost a visual artist. After earning his BFA in Studio Art from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1998 he moved back to California to pursue a career in traditional film animation. During that time there was a downturn on traditional animation opportunities since animation started going digital. Not having qualifications in computer animation he decided to go into film production, working on various films as a PA, sound engineer, and assistant directing.
